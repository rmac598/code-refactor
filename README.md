## Clean up the code

This was an On-the-job ticket. That means we were given the starter code. They wanted us to make things neater so that the code is easier to read and fix or update later on down the road. We were to change the code to semantic.

## Steps taken to clean up the code

in the style.css Got rid of .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, and .benefit-cost because they all have the same paramaters, so made them an aside section. Then changed every .benefit to an aside.
In the index i made it an aside section and put everything inside that bracket instead of having so many section.
